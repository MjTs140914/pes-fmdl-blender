0.4.5  2020-07-01

	* Fixed an issue where mesh splitting would delete bones without any weight painting.
	* Added support for meshes with null materials assigned.

0.4.4  2020-06-30

	* Implemented fmdl string packing.

0.4.3  2020-06-30

	* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.4.2 that broke most exports.
	* Improved exporting bone structure when blender meshes refer to nonexistent bones.
	* Fixed export error reporting.

0.4.2  2020-06-25

	* Fixed an old plugin compatibility issue.

0.4.1  2020-06-25

	* Fixed an issue that would incorrectly merge vertices on split vertex export.

0.4.0  2020-06-22

	* Added support for automatically splitting overlarge meshes into multiple parts on export, and reconstructing them on import.
	* Added support for storing vertices with split normals or split UVs in such a way that they can be reconstructed accurately.
	* Added error messages when trying to export an overlarge mesh.
	* Disabled exporting in edit mode, as this would export the version of the active mesh as it was before editing.

0.3.3  2020-06-22

	* Fixed a bug where the material parameters list could not be scrolled.
	* Fixed a bug where triangulation would raise warnings or break entirely on meshes with broken normals.
